             <p className='font-roboto font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm mt-8 w-[90%]'>The fundamental role or responsibility of bodyguards is to secure their clients (generally VIPs and Celebrities). An executive protection officer’s job is to keep their client out of danger regardless of whether it implies risking their body and life. </p>
             <p className='font-roboto font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm mt-8 w-[90%]'>Individual body-guarding services, or private security, can work for anybody whenever including lawmakers, famous people, or they can be recruited to ensure a nearby business. Generally, on account of an individual of note, various protectors are recruited.</p>
             <p className='font-roboto font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm mt-8 w-[90%]'>Commonly a bodyguard can play the role of driver and are there to ensure their client arrives at the spot they should be. Often,<span className='font-extrabold'> executive protectors</span> are relegated by respectable organizations. It is ideal to search for an organization that has the experience and recruits equipped, experienced, and restrained bodyguards. </p>
             <p className='font-roboto font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm mt-8 w-[90%]'>The role of body guarding is difficult. <span className='text-red-600 font-bold'>Security service organizations </span> should guarantee that their bodyguards are ready and realize what is happening around them consistently. As well as looking after their customer, they need to look at the premises, entryways, galleries, and dubious vehicles. For a protector, his job is to dissuade and diffuse a circumstance before it occurs. The last thing that a protector needs is to need to get genuinely associated with somebody on the grounds that once that happens then, at that point, their customer isn’t properly secured. </p>
             
             <SubHeading text="Our Recruiting and Training Process"/>
             <p className='font-roboto font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm mt-8 w-[90%]'>We recruit bodyguards as per the recruitment policy established by the authority of GSSL; after that guards are sent off to Generation Solution of Security Ltd. Training Academy for 15 days of mandatory basic training. During this period, we initiate Verification’s Request to the special branch of Police for checking an individual’s characters and antecedents. </p>
             <p className='font-roboto font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm mt-8 w-[90%]'>Generally, Ex-police officers are assigned as Bodyguards. Since Army members also have protecting and firearms skills, <span className='font-extrabold'>retired army personnel </span>are also considered bodyguards. Many of us think that no one can become a bodyguard except an army member, but that is not the case. Anyone, in general physically fit, can be a bodyguard. </p>
