        <p className='font-pop font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm my-8'>In addition to these investigations, there are many other types of background screening. Suppose an insurance company is informed that one of their customers has died. His family has to pay the full amount. Now the insurance company has to do background screening before paying the family. They have to be sure if the man is really dead. In that case, they would not be able to find out through their clientâ€™s family.</p>
        <p className='font-pop font-normal text-[#444444] text-sm'>The company has to resort to a third party. In this case, the insurance company can be any company outside the country. In that case, they may have to go to a government or private security company for this background screening. Our company provides this type of background screening security. You can contact us if you need such background screening. We will take the necessary steps to do background screening according to your needs.</p>
